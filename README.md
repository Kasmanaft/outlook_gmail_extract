# outlook_gmail_extract

5 Mail Accounts with access(1 gmail, 4 accounts are large inbox files (.olm)), couple thousand mails and attachments
- Pull all attachments and put them in a folder
- All the contacts of the mails in an Excel List

Project:
1. We need to pull all contact details that we can from the Mail accounts
- Ideally the contact details that are pulled from the mails and maybe the signatures, to be inserted in the excel list in the folder (the only important columns are marked yellow)
2. We need to pull all Mail attachments in a separate folder
